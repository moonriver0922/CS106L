### The idea behind streams

> A stream is an **abstraction** for input/output
>
> You can write **any particular** type to stream
>
> input from user as **string**
>
> output to user as **string**
>
> compute as **object**

### Types of streams

> ==output streams==: can only **receive** data
>
> insertion operator: <<
>
> `<<` converts data to string and **sends** to stream

> ==input streams==: can only give you data
>
> extraction operator: >>
>
> `>>` gets data from stream as a string and convertsit into the appropriate type

- position1: Extracting an integer will read as many characters as possible from the stream.
- position2: Extracting again will skip over any whitespace when reading the next integer.
- position3: When no more data is left, the fail bit will be set to true and input.fail() will return true.			

> Reading into a string using >> will only read a single word, not the whole line.
>
> To read a whole line, use `getline(istream& stream, string& line)`

> example:
>
> ```c++
> static void readHaikuLine() {
>     // Create our ifstream and make it open the file
>     std::ifstream input("../res/haiku.txt");
> 
>     // This will store the lines as we get them form the stream
>     string line;
>     while(true) {
>         std::getline(input, line);
> 
>         // If input is in a fail state, either a value couldn't
>         // be converted, or we are at the end of the file.
>         if(input.fail())
>             break;
>         cout << line << endl;
>     }
> }
> ```

> haiku.txt:

> ```
> Space is limited
> Haiku make it difficult
> To finish what you
> ```
>
> output:
>
> ```txt
> Word read: Space
> Word read: is
> Word read: limited
> Word read: Haiku
> Word read: make
> Word read: it
> Word read: difficult
> Word read: To
> Word read: finish
> Word read: what
> Word read: you
> ```
>
> next let’s do some tests on cin and cout
>
> ```c++
> int main() {
>     char a;
>     cin >> a;
>     cout << a;
>     return 0;
> }
> ```
>
> input:

> 41
>
> output: 
>
> 4
>
> ```c++
> int main() {
>     char a;
>     cin >> a;
>     cout << a+1;
>     return 0;
> }
> ```

> input:

> 41

> output:

> 53
